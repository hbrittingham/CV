<h1> Statistics Projects</h1>
<p>Hayley routinely performs statistical analysis of environmental data to support site decision-making, including developing probability distributions for inputs used in performance and risk assessment models based on information in the literature and data collected at sites. </p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>West Valley Probabilistic Performance Assessment (PPA).</strong></em> Hayley developed a variety of input distributions for use in the West Valley PPA, including those related to radiological and chemical inventory, dose and exposure, biotic transport, and infiltration. She considered temporal and spatial scale for many inputs and adjusted for the difference in spatiotemporal scale between the data and the model based on the nature of the variation in specific parameters. She also provided statistical support to process-level models related to the hydrology at the site, considering various management decision options. She aided in developing a novel approach to integrating process-level model results with a system-level model, which included an accompanying table containing relevant inputs and outputs. She reduced the size of the lookup table by performing a sensitivity analysis on the input distributions as they relate to relevant process-level outputs, thereby increasing computational efficiency of the system-level model. In addition, she incorporated the effects of climate change on the hydrologic process-level model into the system-level model using a broken stick model which gradually implemented the effects of a changing climate over 100 years. </li>
<li><em><strong>Area G Radiologic Risk Assessment (RRA). </strong></em>Hayley developed a variety of distributions for use in the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) RRA, and appropriately accounted for non-linear relationships between inputs and endpoints. For example, she developed a relationship between depth and the proportion of plant roots, that accounts for the non-linear relationship between depth and radiological dose. As another example, she developed an input distribution to consider the effect of snow shielding on the amount of gamma radiation emitted, considering the non-linear and non-additive relationship between snow density, snow depth, and gamma attenuation. She manipulated a large volume of data to develop distributions for inventory estimates, while estimating and accounting for a high degree of uncertainty in the data and utilizing remote machines to increase computational efficiency. </li>
<li><em><strong>Risk Assessment of RDX at LANL.</strong></em> Hayley developed input distributions for a risk assessment modeling hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) groundwater transport and contamination in the regional aquifer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Data informing necessary parameters for this project were particularly sparse, and Hayley creatively utilized a variety of techniques and data sources in order to characterize the state of knowledge in the parameters. Data sources included observational information, literature reviews, process model results, and expert knowledge. Among the techniques utilized were bootstrap sampling, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and expert elicitation in combination with percentile matching. Hayley evaluated and made appropriate adjustments for considerations of independence and bias in the data. </li>
<li><em><strong>Occupancy Models for Bird Species.</strong></em> Hayley developed occupancy and abundance models for birds in the northeastern United States as part of a National Park Service (NPS) project. The complex ecological models accounted for probability of occupancy and detection to estimate abundance in 16 species and 35 parks using 13 years of count data. She analyzed model fits and developed a Shiny app to more easily visualize data, summary statistics, model fits, and the effect of various covariates on model results. </li>
<li><em><strong>Incremental Sampling.</strong></em> Hayley has analyzed data for several risk assessments with designs using incremental sampling methodology (ISM). She has performed background comparisons and calculated upper confidence limits (UCLs) for comparison to endpoints at various large-scale environmental sites. She is familiar with the statistical theory regarding spatial coverage and averaging as it relates to ISM. As part of the ITRC team assembled to revise the ISM guidance, she has written text to inform practitioners on statistical considerations such as spatial trends and homogeneity, background comparisons, and the importance of checking statistical assumptions such as normality and independence. She led a simulation study which analyzed the coverage and accuracy of various UCLs with ISM designs from a variety of underlying distributions under conditions of randomness and independence. </li>
<li><em><strong>GiSdT Development.</strong></em> Hayley built a case study designed to educate policy-makers on structured decision making (SDM) using the software GiSdT, developed by Neptune, and designed a training session for non-statisticians emphasizing graphs to be used in proficiency testing, accounting for differences in data type and study design. She contributed to user guides detailing the SDM process and how this can be integrated into GiSdT. </li>
<li><em><strong>Dyno Nobel Background Soil Comparisons.</strong></em> Hayley constructed a sampling plan for additional locations of background samples for Antimony and Chromium at a site managed by Dyno Nobel in Utah, about 100 ha in area. She sampled coordinates using stratified random sampling and the software Visual Sample Plan (VSP), intended for implementation in a two-sample t-test. She also executed a power analysis to show the effect of sampling additional locations on statistical power, considering various sources of uncertainty.</li>
<li><em><strong>Assessment of Montana Lake Conditions. </strong></em>Hayley adapted the data and method used in EPA’s National Lakes Assessment (NLA) for the population of Montana lakes. She assessed the population of Montana lakes for four different categories: chemical, recreational, biological and physical habitat, using 18 different measurable indicators. She applied the weighted approach used in the NLA to lakes in Montana and considered the imbalance of weights in the sample. She compared the proportion of Montana lakes in each condition category with proportions on a national scale, considering the change in population, and found that Montana lakes were less disturbed than lakes across the US. She also compared lakes in the two different ecoregions in Montana and found that lakes in the Western Mountains are less disturbed than those in the Northern Plains. Finally, she examined the correlation between indicators by computing relative risk figures and explained the meaning and usefulness of these figures. </li>
<li><em><strong>Statistical Consulting for Neuroscience Data, Pennsylvania State University.</strong></em> For her Masters project, Hayley worked as a statistical consultant for a neuroscience lab, developing standard protocols for six different data structures for future use by the lab. Statistical methods included linear regression, ANOVA, Dunnett’s and Tukey’s mean comparisons, logistic regression and ANCOVA. The final report consisted of a flow chart to guide the scientists as to which method may be appropriate, exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots using example data, statistical analysis and interpretation of results, diagnostics, reproducible R code, and additional comments on special considerations such as transformations, bimodal data, dummy variables, and adjusting for false discovery rate (FDR). </li>
<li><em><strong>Polyploidy and Range Breadth, University of Pittsburgh. </strong></em>Hayley was the lead researcher on a study that established chromosome counts as a determinant of range breadth. She developed multiple regression models for plant species, correcting for ecological complications, and compared the fit of various stochastic models to be used as a framework. She developed a standardized method for estimating the area of a species’ range size. She extracted geographic, bioclimatic, and UV data from an online database using GIS.</li>
